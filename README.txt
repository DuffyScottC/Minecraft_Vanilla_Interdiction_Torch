Check back frequently for new versions! Please post any questions, report any glitches or problems, and provide suggestions on the forums!

------------------Setup instructions:---------------------
1. Move this whole folder (called "repel_torch") to your world's "functions" folder. 
	- The "functions" folder is located in your ".minecraft" folder ("minecraft" for 
	Mac) in: saves/YOUR_WORLD_FOLDER/data/functions

	- To find your ".minecraft" folder on Windows:
		1. Open "Start" menu
		2. Type %appdata%
		3. Open ".minecraft"

	- To find your "minecraft" folder on Mac:
		1. Click Finder (in your applications bar, or type command+spacebar and 
		search Finder, then press enter)
		2. Click the "Go" menu at the top of your screen
		3. Hold the "shift" key and click "Library" ("Library" only appears when 
		you hold shift)
		4. Open "Application Support"
		5. Open "minecraft"

2. If you have commands/cheats enabled in your world, skip this step. If not:
	- Open your world
	- Pause the game
	- Press "Open to LAN"
	- Set "Allow Cheats" to "ON"
	- Click "Start LAN World"
	- You now have cheats enabled temporarily, so that you can set up the interdiction
	torch functions. You won't need to do this after you've followed these 
	instructions once.

3. Type the command "/reload" onto the chat (OR close and reopen your world)

4. Type the following command into chat and press enter:
	/function repel_torch:initialize

And there you have it! You should be all set up! If you have problems, consult the forums.

------------------How to use this mod:---------------------

--------------Craft an Interdiction Torch
To get an Interdiction Torch, follow these steps:
1. Create an Alchemy Pit
	- Place 8 obsidian blocks on the ground in a square, leaving a hole in the middle
	- Pour a bucket of water into the hole
	- It should look like this (O=obsidian, W=water source block):
	OOO
	OWO
	OOO

2. Toss a Diamond into the water (don't toss a stack of 2 or more diamonds at once! That won't work!)

3. Voila! You should have an Interdiction Torch in your inventory! (It should look like an armor stand with an enchantment. You can place it on the floor or on walls like a regular torch)
---------------Use an Interdiction Torch
You simply have to place an Interdiction Torch on the ground. (If your particles are not set to Minimal, you will see a green flame on Interdiction Torches)

To pick it back up, just break the torch. It will give you back your Interdiction Torch armor stand like a regular item. It will even work if you break the block the Interdiction Torch is attached to, or if a creeper explodes it.

Interdiction Torches repel 
	- Hostile mobs (except Ghasts, Slimes, and Magma Cubes)
	- Arrows
	- Ghast fireballs
	- Blaze fireballs (very glitchy with this version)
within a 6 block radius.

You can combine multiple interdiction torches to form protective barriers. Note: This version does not prevent mob spawning.
